        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>I am Anush, and I have been trading for the past 3 years. After extensive research and comparison with other trading strategies (such as Supply and Demand), I developed this **Math-Progressive Trading Strategy**. I have just passed out of 12th grade and am now looking to scale my strategy with investor funding.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide2">
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>I wish to start my own trading firm, leveraging this **Math-Progressive Trading Strategy** to generate consistent profits. My goal is to scale this strategy with investor funding and establish a successful, data-driven trading operation.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide3">
        <h2>The Strategy Overview</h2>
        <p>Fixed Time Trading (FTT) is a form of trading where traders predict whether an asset’s price will go up or down within a fixed period (e.g., 1 minute). This strategy uses **Technical Analysis** with RSI and Stochastic Oscillator indicators for high-probability trade signals.</p>
        <p>Have a look at this video for a better understanding: <a href="https://youtu.be/Xjkk_fVLfgU" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Xjkk_fVLfgU</a></p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide4">
        <h2>How the Strategy Works</h2>
        <p>- **1-Minute Timeframe**: Trades are placed on short-term candles for higher accuracy.<br>
           - **Trade Confirmation**: Multiple indicators must align to confirm a buy or sell signal.<br>
           - **Execution**: Only enter trades when the majority of indicators provide the same direction, increasing the probability of success.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide5">
        <h2>The Math Behind It (Progressive Betting)</h2>
        <p>This strategy uses a progressive staking method where trades increase in size after a loss. The goal is to recover losses efficiently while maximizing winning streaks.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide6">
        <h2>Risk Management</h2>
        <p>- Position sizing is controlled to prevent excessive drawdowns.<br>
           - Loss limits are implemented to avoid significant risk exposure.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide7">
        <h2>Performance (Real or Backtested Results)</h2>
        <p>My backtested results and real trading data show a high probability of success with a strong win rate. Key metrics include:<br>
           - Average win rate: X%<br>
           - Risk-to-reward ratio: X:X</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide8">
        <h2>Why This Works</h2>
        <p>- Statistical edge due to high-probability setups.<br>
           - Progressive staking ensures a structured approach to recovering losses.<br>
           - Minimization of risks through technical confirmations.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide9">
        <h2>The Investor Opportunity</h2>
        <p>Investors can participate through a **profit-sharing model**, earning returns as the strategy generates profits. This presents a strong opportunity for high potential gains.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class="slide" id="slide10">
        <h2>Why Funding Can Change Your Life</h2>
        <p>By funding this strategy, investors can gain substantial profits through the profit-sharing model. Given the strategy’s high potential, this can be a life-changing opportunity.</p>
